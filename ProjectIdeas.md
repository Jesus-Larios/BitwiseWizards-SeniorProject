1. ### Too long of a title but this is for a school project so the fact that its long is okay were helping to hit a non existent word quota
A RPG turn based combat using scenes to depict various battlefields  and different non-combative zones such as places to regain expended resources or obtain new ones. Using a database to fetch and store player data and records and a live service API such as websocket to allow for two way communication between the server and the client to allow for live sessions with other players.

4. ### TrustTrade

TrustTrade would be a social platform that revolutionizes how traders interact by requiring portfolio verification through Plaid integration (optional but highlighted). Users who connect their brokerage accounts get a "Verified Portfolio" badge, displaying their real-time portfolio value, current stock positions, option contracts, and quantity of holdings. This verification system creates a hierarchy of trust, where verified users' posts and analyses carry more weight than unverified accounts. The platform would feature a "Performance Score" that tracks verified users' trading history, win rates, and risk-adjusted returns, making it impossible to fake success. Users can create detailed trade journals with entry/exit points, reasoning, and outcome analysis, all backed by verified transaction data.

Vision Statement:

TrustTrade, To build an open and transparent trading community where everyone can learn, grow, and succeed together. By combining verified performance with accessible knowledge sharing, we're creating a space where both novice and experienced traders can collaborate, validate their strategies, and help each other achieve financial success. Our platform breaks down traditional barriers in trading, making proven strategies and real-time insights available to all. Yes there is a competitor that is only an app currently called “AfterHour”, we will have a news section and performance scores for both users and stocks potentially that’ll set us apart. Ours will also only be web based. Also guest accounts available with limited access(no live feed or access to our api queries, only viewing). 

Reasonable Scope:

The core user needs to center around trust and verification in the trading community. Users need a reliable way to verify legitimate traders and validate performance claims, protecting themselves against misinformation that plagues current trading communities. They also have strong needs around learning and growth, wanting to understand successful strategies while learning from others' experiences. The social aspect is crucial - users need to connect with like-minded traders, engage in collaborative learning.
Our portfolio verification system addresses the trust problem through Plaid integration for brokerage connections, implementing a verified badge system and performance tracking metrics. Users can maintain privacy through granular controls over their sensitive data, solving the critical problem of fake success claims in trading communities.
The social trading features enable real-time position sharing, trade journaling, strategy discussions, and custom watchlists(maybe). This solves the common problem of isolation in trading decisions, allowing users to validate their thinking and learn from others in real-time. The educational components further support this through detailed strategy breakdowns from verified traders, and historical trade analysis, effectively bridging the knowledge gap between new and experienced traders.
Community management tools include a sophisticated reputation scoring system, content moderation capabilities, group creation tools, and private messaging. These features create safe, focused discussion spaces where quality insights rise to the top. The market intelligence features provide real-time updates, sentiment analysis, and tracking of popular trader movements, helping users identify market opportunities more effectively.
The system itself has significant technical requirements including high availability with consistent uptime, real-time data processing capabilities, secure data storage, and scalable infrastructure. Compliance and security needs are paramount, requiring robust data privacy measures, and adherence to financial regulations. Performance requirements demand low latency updates, support for high concurrent users, efficient data caching, and mobile responsiveness. The system must also seamlessly integrate with various brokerage APIs, market data feeds, payment processors, and authentication services.
