# Projects in no particular order
1. ### Too long of a title but this is for a school project so the fact that its long is okay were helping to hit a non existent word quota
A RPG turn based combat using scenes to depict various battlefields  and different non-combative zones such as places to regain expended resources or obtain new ones. Using a database to fetch and store player data and records and a live service API such as websocket to allow for two way communication between the server and the client to allow for live sessions with other players.

4. ### TrustTrade
TrustTrade would be a social platform that revolutionizes how traders interact by requiring portfolio verification through Plaid integration (optional but highlighted). Users who connect their brokerage accounts get a "Verified Portfolio" badge, displaying their real-time portfolio value, current stock positions, option contracts, and quantity of holdings. This verification system creates a hierarchy of trust, where verified users' posts and analyses carry more weight than unverified accounts. The platform would feature a "Performance Score" that tracks verified users' trading history, win rates, and risk-adjusted returns, making it impossible to fake success. Users can create detailed trade journals with entry/exit points, reasoning, and outcome analysis, all backed by verified transaction data.
